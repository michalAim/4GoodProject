# 4GoodProject

##------------------------------------------------------##

The project was built as part of the MVP for the ##4Good third party.
The goal of 4Good is to generate commissions from e-commerce sites in order to benefit non-profit organizations. This will be held by 4Good online marketplace platform.
We created Retool boards as part of our MVP so entrepreneurs can easily track and manage their data.
The project was developed in ReactJS and NodeJS.
Other: MongoDB, MaterialUI, OAuth 2.0 and Postman.
